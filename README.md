## Map Introductions

**To play custom map as a mod, place Civ6Map file under the directory of `C:\Users\{your user name}\Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Saves\WorldBuilder`.**

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/output/grec.Civ6Map>Aegean Sea</a>

Aegean Sea, the cradle of European civilizations, hosts five different civilization leaders. In contrast to few hexagons in True Start Europe or Mediterranean, this map grants the possibility of chariots, horsemen, galleys and quadriremes fighting on the enormous area of land and sea. To revive the glory of Roman empire, one must reign the fertile land of Constantinople and conquer Mount Olympus.

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/output/afrique.Civ6Map>Africa</a>

Africa, birthplace of mankind, is the second largest continent with a vast amount of untapped natural resources. Since the map covers more than just Africa, you get to choose your role in the game. Whether the indigenous tribe leader who intends to fight the intruders or the foreign colonizer who seeks to exploit the exotic land, everyone can find a role to play in the long history of the civilization.

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/output/antarctique.Civ6Map>Antartic Circle</a>

Although Antarctic Treaty demilitarize the polar desert, will it really stop the ambitious leaders in Civilization 6? To add fuel to the fire, numerous mineral deposits are sitting beneath the giant ice sheet. Nonetheless, beware of blistering snowstorm! All the urban development can be destroyed in three rounds of blizzard. Lack of food yield on snow/tundra terrains can be a great obstacle to colonize Antarctica. Play your strategy well to survive in the eternal cold.

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/output/arctique.Civ6Map>Arctic Circle</a>

Arctic circle is a regional map that covers the majority of the northern hemisphere. The haute couture of this map is the very north. Strategic resources in this map is scarcely distributed across the continents yet concentrated inside Arctic circle. Mineral resources are modified so they can be spawned and mined on the terrains such as snow and snow hill. Leaders in this map have been given carte blanche to tap into the potential resources under the ice. Imagine a war on Greenland or Svalbard over the occurrence of aluminum. Arctic shipping routes become the new normal. This might be the future we are about to live in.

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/output/asean.Civ6Map>ASEAN</a>

Say you want to play the map of archipelago because you are a leader of maritime civilization. What could be better than Southeast Asia where you have more than twenty-five thousand islands in the region? Sailing rafts in the uncharted water to conquer tropical islands is the only way to bring prosperity in this map. Embrace the wildfire, the volcano eruption and the flood. Good rewards come after navigating these natural disasters well.

> This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.

Yes, that’s what Caribbean map is all about. We all know the original game offers The Pirates scenario which resembles Sid Meier's Pirates but that doesn’t feel like a true civilization game. In this map, you get to play as indigenous leaders in Mesoamerica or four colonization powers plus Teddy Roosevelt. Be aware of Black Pearl Frigate. The pirates will raid the merchant ships and bury your treasure in a remote island. Also, these pirates are seeking the legendary natural wonder — youth fountain. It will be a fool not to join, savvy?

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/output/le%20monde%20entier.Civ6Map>Distorted Earth</a>

The problem with TSL earth/huge earth is the ocean, simply too much water on the surface. Civilizations are spending a lot of time sailing rather than exploring. Whereas in distorted earth, only 30% of the surface is water. The map bears a resemblance to TSL earth with a much smaller Atlantic and Pacific. The exciting news is distorted earth doesn’t only preserve most of the terrains, features and resources in TSL earth, but it also includes all the natural wonders, city states and resources which do not get spawned in TSL earth.

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/output/ukraine.Civ6Map>Ukraine</a>

To defend people, liberty, sovereignty and civilization, this map focuses on Black Sea and Caspian Sea. To be more specific, the map is a salute to the warriors in Ukraine who bravely fight against the dictator and his invasion. Unfortunately, there is no Ukrainian leader in the game. There are only two options left – Jadwiga of Poland and Tamar of Georgia. Fight for the post-soviet prosperity, fight for the honor and fight for the democracy!

What could be the destiny of Vikings? Aquaculture in Vinland, Ragnarok in Valhalla, longship to Faroes or pillages and raids in Anglo-Saxon? Yes, this is what the map of Scandinavian peninsula is about. Now the chance is given to reshape the narrative of your civilization in Norse mythology. The population is booming and the food yield is stagnant. Grab the axe and the shield to expand the territory.

## Script Instructions

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/basemap2civ6map.ipynb>Basemap2Civ6map Converter</a>

The script leverages python to create fantastic in-game map from basemap package (of any latitude, longitude, altitude, angle and projection). This can even be replicated on any image with designated color2terrain mapping. It will automate the geotagging of natural wonders, terrains, features, continents, resources, rivers, cliffs, true start locations of civilizations and city-states. An example is showed below.

Arctic circle converted to Civ6Map

![alt text](https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/preview/civ6map.png)

*Source of all geospatial data can be found <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/data/source.md>here</a>.*

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/choropleth%20reader.ipynb>Choropleth Reader</a>

The script can process a choropleth image and reverse engineer colors back to the original scale-free data with latitudes and longitudes.

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/tifreader.ipynb>Geotiff Image Reader</a>

Best tool to recover spatial dataset from geotiff images and filter 95 percentile of the data.

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/mindat.ipynb>Mindat ETL Pipeline</a>

<a href=https://www.mindat.org>Mindat</a> is an excellent and free mineral database. The script scrapes the website to extract localities of different mineral deposits and dump into a nice and tidy dataframe.

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/shpreader.ipynb>Shape File Reader</a>

Similar to geotiff image reader, the script utilizes the same package to extract coordinates from shape file.

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/xmlreader.ipynb>XML Reader</a>

All relevant information regarding terrains, features and resources are stored inside XML files across DLC folders and Base Gameplay folders. This is a friendly helper to aggregate information such as tile size, spawning conditions and probabilities.

## Mod Demonstrations

The river is one of the most complicated features in civ6map. The lack of documentation took me a whole damn afternoon to grasp on how it works in the database. Rivers pass on the edge of each hexagon. There are six edges for each hexagon but each hexagon effectively controls only three edges -- the bottom left, the bottom right and the right. Normally we’d call them southwest, southeast and east edge of a hexagon. However, they are called northeast, northwest and west in civ6map as the orientation is based upon the hexagon that share a common edge with our target ID.

![alt text](https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/preview/riveredge.png)

The flow direction is purely clockwise. In clockwise direction, the first edge of the hexagon is 0, the second is 1, so on and so forth. When no water flows through the edge, the direction is denoted by -1.
