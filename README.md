### Maps

* <a href=https://github.com/je-suis-tm/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-6-modding/blob/main/output/arctique.Civ6Map>Arctic Circle</a>

Arctic circle is a regional map that covers the majority of the northern hemisphere. The haute couture of this map is the very north. Strategic resources in this map is scarcely distributed across the continents yet concentrated inside Arctic circle. Mineral resources are modified so they can be spawned and mined on the terrains such as snow and snow hill. Leaders in this map have been given carte blanche to tap into the potential resources under the ice. Imagine a war on Greenland or Svalbard over the occurrence of aluminum. Arctic shipping routes become the new normal. This might be the future we are about to live in.

The problem with TSL earth/huge earth is the ocean, simply too much water on the surface. Civilizations are spending a lot of time sailing rather than exploring. Whereas in distorted earth, only 30% of the surface is water. The map bears a resemblance to TSL earth with a much smaller Atlantic and Pacific. The exciting news is distorted earth doesnâ€™t only preserve most of the terrains, features and resources in TSL earth, but it also includes all the natural wonders, city states and resources which do not get spawned in TSL earth.

### Scripts

Use python to automate some of the modding process. 

* Create fantastic in-game map from python basemap (of any latitude, longitude, altitude, angle and projection) or any image with designated color2terrain mapping. 

* Automate the geotagging of natural wonders, terrains, features, continents, resources, true start locations of civilizations and city-states.
